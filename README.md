## 📘 Overview

**Valley Scanner** is a computational project designed to explore and confirm zeros of the **Riemann Zeta function** through a *homogeneous scanning method* that does **not rely on Gram points, alignment corrections, or interpolation models**.

Instead, the method performs a continuous walk across real numbers converted into the complex domain, identifying *valleys* (local minima) in $|Z(s)|$ that correspond precisely to nontrivial zeros on the critical line $\Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$.

This project demonstrates a **direct, reproducible pathway to detect zeros**, making the exploration transparent, geometrically intuitive, and free from traditional boundary dependencies.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Classical approaches to locating zeta zeros often rely on **Gram point alignment** or numerical phase tracking, which introduce discrete artifacts or “gaps” at scale.

The **Valley Scanner** instead follows a continuous, density-preserving process:

* It walks through $t$ values along the critical line, evaluating $|Z(1/2 + it)|$ directly.
* It detects local minima ("valleys") between successive maxima ("mountains").
* Each confirmed valley corresponds to a verified zero of $\zeta(s)$.

This homogeneous structure reproduces the correct zero density naturally, without preconditioning or fitted corrections.
In short: **the terrain itself reveals the zeros.**

## 🧩 What’s Published

### 🧠 Research Highlights

* Demonstration that $|Z(s)|$ terrain symmetry can reproduce zero density without Gram alignment.
* Experimental validation at multiple $t$ scales (up to $t \approx 2\times10^{15}$).
* high-t evaluations beyond $t = 10^{20}$ showing numerical stability and precision.
* Complete datasets and Python tools for reproducibility.

### 📄 Academic Paper

The companion paper describes the statistical analysis, comparisons with the Riemann–von Mangoldt prediction, and the datasets used to validate the approach.

> 📘 The paper and datasets together show that a continuous, unaligned scanning process can recover the full zero structure of $\zeta(s)$.

## 🧪 Playground: Visualizing Mountains and Valleys

The file **`playground.py`** offers the simplest way to watch the valley scanner in action.
It plots $|Z(s)|$ against $t$ for low-height ranges, showing:

* **Mountains:** local maxima of $|Z(s)|$
* **Valleys:** confirmed zeros of $\zeta(s)$

To run it:

```bash
python3 playground.py
```

You’ll see a graphical plot where each valley corresponds to a confirmed zero.
This script is ideal for newcomers who want to visually confirm how the method detects zeros geometrically.

## 📂 Datasets

The repository includes:

* Datasets published in the paper (`refined_sample_*.csv`)
* Additional high-t datasets confirming reproducibility and valley consistency across independent runs.

Each dataset contains:

```
t, absZ, spacing
```

Where:

* **t** = imaginary part along the critical line
* **absZ** = $|Z(s)|$ value
* **spacing** = $\Delta t$ between consecutive zeros

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

* Calculations use **MPFR precision arithmetic** for numerical stability.
* High-t runs are distributed across multi-core EC2 instances (up to 192 CPUs per job).
* Each confirmed zero is verified by symmetric evaluation of conjugate terms.
* The process supports horizontal scaling — distributed batches can theoretically reach *cosmic-$t$* ranges (beyond $10^{22}$) with sufficient resources.

## 🐳 Docker Image

A prebuilt container is available on Docker Hub for direct use of the core computational engine.

Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull jacobore/jor_z:native
```

Run an interactive shell:

```bash
docker run --rm -it jacobore/jor_z:native
```

Once inside the container, you can execute the core tools through the helper script:

### 🔧 Core Execution Commands

### ⚙️ CPU and Parallelism Configuration

The container uses **OpenMP** for parallel processing.
You can fine-tune CPU concurrency and thread binding to match your hardware by setting the following environment variables when running the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e OMP_NUM_THREADS=32 \
  -e OMP_PROC_BIND=spread \
  -e OMP_PLACES=cores \
  jacobore/jor_z:native
```

**Variables:**

* `OMP_NUM_THREADS` → number of threads (typically equal to your CPU core count).
* `OMP_PROC_BIND` → thread placement policy (`close`, `spread`, or `master`).
* `OMP_PLACES` → where threads are placed (`cores`, `sockets`, or `threads`).

Tuning these values allows the core to **adapt CPU concurrency** for your machine’s architecture and achieve optimal performance.
